		<p id="headingbirth">I was born to a royal family in <em>Amsterdam, Netherlands</em>. This was my <strong>family</strong>. <br></p>
		<ul id="backstory">
			<li>My <strong>father</strong> was the crown <em>king</em> of Mesopotamia. His reign over the badlands held our position as royalty for many years.<br>As the reinforcer of Murabi code in Babylon, our family had the prestigous honor of protecting Barack Obama.</li>
			<li>My <strong>mother</strong> was the <em>queen of Andorra</em>. She was dethroned after the king of England told her she had smelly shoes. <br>No kizzy, she kinda did have smelly shoes. Straight up, it wasn't fair that all the people didn't like her ruling.<br>She was super dope and considerate on god. So don't test me gamer. </li>
			<li>My <strong>brother</strong> was the special <em>cultural attach√©</em> that was sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo. His knowledge knew no bounds. <br>His mission was to project Mesopotamian cultural values. I'm not even going to cap with you, my bro is about to marry <br>this really good looking princess from the Qing Dynasty. </li>
			<li><strong>I</strong> was born with the ability to <em>eat cheese</em>. This was obviously very important in Mesopotamian culture as it showed my value of fromage. <br>Now I don't wanna cap with you, I was kinda a shy kid on god, but when I got to 6 months old, I was already able to bench about <br>4000lbs. I'm just that cool. </li>

		<p>Elementary school was kind of a goofy ah time for me. I was bullied for being the dopest kid in Mesopotamia. I had these really dope shades<br>that everyone was REALLY jealous of. Anyway, here's a list of all my grades in elementary school. I loved my teacher. </p>

		<h2 id="middle">Middle School</h2>
		<p>I went to a meditative retreat with my class to <em>Katmandu, Nepal</em>. This home of the Himilayas was beautiful. The immaculate view struck me<br>like my first dose of creatine in college. As I climbed Mt. Everest, I realized that the only way I could find inner peace like Po in kung fu <br>panda was to eat so many dumpings that I literally became a panda. In middle school, I mostly focused on <stonrg>my destiny of becoming the dragon <br>warrior</strong> and fighting Tai Lung and <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dreamworks/images/e/e1/Li-shan.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161114155949">Li Shan</a>.

		<h2 id="high">High School</h2>
		<p>In high school, I was invited from my home country of Mesopotamia to be part of the first space mission to <em>Mars</em>. Elon Musk was my guide <br>and assistant to the mission. He helped me triangulate the quantum gravity theorem for space calculus. Together, we started the <strong>monkey <br>business</strong> Dota 2 pro team. From space, we were competing to become esports pros. Just kidding, I'm not that much of a loser.
